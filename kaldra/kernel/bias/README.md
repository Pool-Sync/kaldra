# KALDRA-Bias Kernel

## Overview

KALDRA-Bias is the core module of the KALDRA system, designed to detect and analyze biases in textual content, with a special focus on content generated by AI models. It serves as a tool for auditing, monitoring, and understanding the nuances of bias in language.

## MVP v0.1 Objective

The primary goal of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) v0.1 is to provide a functional API endpoint that can analyze a given text and return a structured JSON response with a bias assessment.

The MVP will:
- Accept a text input via a REST API.
- Generate sentence embeddings.
- Project the embeddings into a 12-archetype space (Δ12).
- Apply a cultural modulation layer (3x48).
- Calculate a simple `bias_score` using a baseline machine learning model.
- Return a JSON response containing the `bias_score`, a classification `label` (biased, neutral, or inconclusive), `confidence`, the dominant `archetype`, the `plan` (3, 6, or 9), and a short `explanation`.

## Directory Structure

- **`api/`**: Contains the FastAPI application, defining the API endpoints for interacting with the KALDRA-Bias model.
- **`data/`**: Holds all data-related files, including archetype definitions, cultural modulation tables, datasets for training and evaluation, and examples.
- **`src/`**: The main source code for the KALDRA-Bias pipeline, including modules for embedding generation, archetype mapping, scoring, and explanation.
- **`eval/`**: Includes scripts and documentation related to the evaluation of the model's performance and fairness metrics.
